        <h1>Great music venues in Spinningfields</h1>
        <p>Spinningfields is an area in the west adjoining the middle part of Deansgate and the main business district of the city centre.
            <br>The proposal to create a designated central business district originated in 1997 when Allied London purchased a number of buildings around the John Rylands Library.
            <br>Allied London executive Mike Ingall was convinced of the site's regeneration potential and Manchester City Council was keen to redevelop the city centre after the 1996 Manchester bombing.
            <br>The development, named from a narrow street which ran westwards from Deansgate, is bounded by Bridge Street to the north, Quay Street to the south, Deansgate to the east, and the River Irwell to the west.
